# Topic
The reflective writing component will require members of the group to write an essay reflecting on the process of completing the project. The essay should be approximately 1500 words. The essay topic will vary from semester to semester and be released and discussed in the week 7 seminar.

In semester 1 2017, the essay topic is as follows:
The way we interface with software has changed rapidly in recent years. Keyboard, mouse and screen are giving way to voice, vision, stylus, gesture, accelerometer; software may interact with you passively performing actions based on your location rather than an explicit action; and augmented reality applications inject information into our perceived environment. This new modes of interaction are emerging and are hard to predict and plan for. How do you think a software development process should plan for emerging or untested human interfaces? Consider this question in the context of your own CITS555X design project. Also consider how these technologies affect clients (managing expectations), developers (retraining), and product life cycle (planned obsolescence vs constant refactoring).

# Questions
- How software development process should plan for emerging or untested human interfaces.
- Combine it with the context of the Design Project
- How it affect:
  1. clients
  2. developers
  3. product life cycle


# Some ideas
- Human Computer Interface, the input changes nowadays. It is not something totally new, but something we have researched about with long times. Conversing interface, the problem here is
# Outline
1. What is the problem: interface are not predictable, reproducible and countable
2. Problem for software developer:
  - The main problem is for the people who research about human computer interface, but for software engineer should also considered the problem. Because, it is some kind of Conversing interface which is hard to control because the system will misunderstand the meaning and command of the user.
  - To be specific, when we do the coding things, we can use different techniques implement what is in the requirement documents, it will cause problems in software requirements analysis, how specify it and make it very clear, there is no misunderstanding
  - As well, it is hard to test, so it will be a hard work for the test engineer
3. Proposal Solutions
