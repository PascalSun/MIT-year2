# Topic
The reflective writing component will require members of the group to write an essay reflecting on the process of completing the project. The essay should be approximately 1500 words. The essay topic will vary from semester to semester and be released and discussed in the week 7 seminar.

In semester 1 2017, the essay topic is as follows:
The way we interface with software has changed rapidly in recent years. Keyboard, mouse and screen are giving way to voice, vision, stylus, gesture, accelerometer; software may interact with you passively performing actions based on your location rather than an explicit action; and augmented reality applications inject information into our perceived environment. This new modes of interaction are emerging and are hard to predict and plan for. How do you think a software development process should plan for emerging or untested human interfaces? Consider this question in the context of your own CITS555X design project. Also consider how these technologies affect clients (managing expectations), developers (retraining), and product life cycle (planned obsolescence vs constant refactoring).

# Questions
- How software development process should plan for emerging or untested human interfaces.
- Combine it with the context of the Design Project
- How it affect:
  1. clients
  2. developers
  3. product life cycle
