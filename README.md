- Aim: Need to develop a website with match functions using mean stack
- Due Date: 2017.5.26
### About my project

Use MEAN to setup a website have the functions below:
1. A user account and login feature.
2. The ability to edit personal details and preferences.
3. A method to browse potential matches, and initiate some form of contact or communication.

4. Reacting to other users events (a new match has logged on, or some is viewing your profile...).
5. Realtime chat between logged in users.
6. Graphical representations of match quality.
7. Location based matching.
