# Notes

'''
  [1] Model parameters required or allowed are as follows:

  'hosts-file'     :
  'locations-file' :
  'duration'       : number of cycles to run simulation
  'vector-diffusion-probability' :
    per (active) cycle probability of a vector moving to an 
    adjacent cell; this would be calculated from eg a diffusion
    coefficient and cell geometry
  'biting-rate'    : mean number of bites per cycle for each
                     vector
  'vector-infection-probability' :
  'host-infection-probability'   :
    probability of infection per bite given susceptible
    vector (host) and infectious host (vector)
  'vector-e-to-i-rate' :
  'host-e-to-i-rate'   :
  'host-i-to-r-rate'   :
    per-cycle mean rates of infection progression (i.e.
    mean period is 1/rate in cycles)
  'vector-birth-rate' : per-cycle mean number of immature
    vectors created by each adult vector
  'vector-maturation-rate' : per-cycle mean rate of immature
    vectors becoming adults
  'vector-death-rate' : per-cycle vector mortality (i.e.
    mean lifespan is 1/rate)

  [2] Hosts are keyed on an individual ID integer (IID). Host
      objects are dictionaries with the following fields

  'i-state'  : infection state, character S,E,I or R
  'location' : location ID of current cell

  fixed (not dynamic state):

  'iid'      : host id
  'home'     : location ID of home cell
  'hub'      : location ID of daytime cell (-1 for none)

  The serialised form is a JSON dictionary, keyed on string
  representations of host ID numbers.

  [3] Locations are keyed on cell ID integers (CID). Location
      objects are dictionaries with:

  'hosts'       : set of IIDs of hosts currently in cell
  'v-capacity'  : density (vectors per cell) at
    which birth rate becomes zero
  'v-immature'  : number of immature (egg, larvae, pupae) in cell
  'v-state'     : stored as a 4-vector or numbers in states
                  SEIR. A bit brittle if number of states changes
                  eg locations[27]['v-state'][I] is the number 
                  of vectors currently in I state in cell 27.
                  R is not actually used for vectors.

  fixed (not dynamic state):

  'cid'         : cell id
  'coordinates' : list of float co-ordinates ie [x,y]

  The serialised form is a JSON dictionary, keyed on string
  representations of location ID numbers.

  [4] This is where parameter checking would go.

  [5] Assume vectors are diurnal movers.

  [6] Derivation of force of infection on vectors.

  We want to calculate the expected number of infectious
  bites for each vector.

  br : 
    number of bites by vector
  br * (ih/nh) : 
    only (ih/nh) of bites will be on infectious hosts
  br * (ih/in) * pbip : 
    only some of those bites will transmit

  beta = (float(ipop) / float(npop)) * br * pbip

  [7] Derivation of force of infection on hosts.

  We want the expected number of infectious bites on each host.

  br : 
    number of bites per vector
  br * iv : 
    total number of bites by infectious vectors
  br * iv * (1/nh) : 
    number of those bites on each human
  br * iv * (1/nh) * pbip : 
    only some of those bites will transmit

    beta = br*pbip*float(nvi) / float(hpop)

  [8] Events are written to stdout as CSV lines. The first two
      fields are always the cycle number and an event type
      string. The remaining fields depend on the event type.

      Event types:
      'i' : host infection event
            field 0, 1 : cycle, 'i'
            field 2, 3 : iid, cid
